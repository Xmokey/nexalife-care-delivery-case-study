## Overview

NexaLife Care (previously known as Synergy Care Pro) functions as an **appointment-focused referral and care-coordination platform**, designed to connect clinics and patients through a secure, compliant, and traceable digital system.

The platform supports **two structured patient journeys**:
- Digitally independent users (self-registration & booking)
- Assisted users requiring in-person onboarding and transport coordination

I led end-to-end delivery across product definition, workflow design, development coordination, and go-live readiness.

No proprietary source code is included.
