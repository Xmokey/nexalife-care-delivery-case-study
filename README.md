> **Status:** Delivered / In Active Use  
> **Product Type:** Role-based, appointment-focused platform

## Overview

NexaLife Care functions as an **appointment-focused referral and care-coordination platform**, designed to connect clinics, patients, field teams, and advocates through a secure, compliant, and traceable digital system.

The platform is built around **two distinct patient journeys** — digitally independent users and assisted users who require in-person onboarding and transport — while maintaining strict controls around consent, privacy, and regulatory compliance.

I served as **Project Director**, responsible for coordinating end-to-end delivery across product definition, development execution, operational workflows, and go-live readiness.

This repository documents **platform delivery scope, system design outcomes, and execution oversight**.  
No proprietary source code is included.
